To run this software, execute the "Outage_bound.m" script in MATLAB.

Parameters can be set by editing "Outage_bound.m"

NOTE*: The evaluation of Outage probability doesn't work for a small subset of 
SNR and m,n parameters due to high numerical precision required. This can 
be resolved using symbolic computation. For such cases, however, we used 
Online tool "Wolframalpha". The folder has a text file with name 
"Outage probability bound for (Fig. 10 in Jayaweera paper)__WOLFRAMALPHA.txt" 
containing values for such cases.
